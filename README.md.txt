# Distributed-Serverless-Compute-Service

This repository contains the project work completed as part of the "Introduction to Distributed Systems" course. The finished project can be found under the "stage5" directory.

## Overview
The goal of this project was to create a distributed, fault-tolerant serverless compute service.


Distributed systems concepts employed:
* Zookeeper leader-election algorithm
* Master-worker task distribution
* Heartbeat monitor (fault tolerance)
* TCP, UDP, HTTP protocols
